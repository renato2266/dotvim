Keep your dotfiles in git

The following instructions assume that your home directory contains a .vimrc file, a .vim directory and a .gvimrc file (optional).

Move the .vimrc and .gvimrc files into the .vim directory:

mv .vimrc ~/.vim/vimrc
mv .gvimrc ~/.vim/gvimrc

Create symbolic links so that ~/.vimrc points to the ~/.vim/vimrc file:

ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
Change to the .vim directory, and initialize it as a git repository:

cd ~/.vim
git init
Create a README file, and paste installation instructions into it (see example README).

Add all files, and make an initial commit:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

I suggest publishing your dotvim files to github: itâ€™s really easy to set up an account, and they host open source projects for free. In the video, I demonstrate how to publish a git repository to github.
